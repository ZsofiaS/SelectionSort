# Selection sort

Selection sort is the simplest sorting algorithm.
The time complexity is O(nÂ²) as we are searching over a list (O(n)), and we have to do this n times, for every element on the list.

### How to use

Open `SpecRunner.html` in the browser. This will run all the tests.

In the browser console, create a new instance of sort: `let sort = new Sort()`.  
Run the function `selectionSort` with an array input of your choice, like so:  
`sort.selectionSort([1,3,5,2,7])`.


This is part of my algorithms project to validate my understanding of algorithmic complexity, and coding while learning the topics.
